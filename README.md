# Moving Car Socket.io
This project is a car movement simulation using Three.js & Socket.io. Users can control the car using the WASD keys to move in various directions in a 3D world. The project leverages Three.js for rendering the 3D environment and Socket.io for real-time multiplayer functionality, allowing multiple players to interact and play together.
